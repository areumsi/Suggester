Suggester is a suggestion-focused Discord bot whose main purpose is to allow server managers to receive feedback from their members and improve their communities. It makes handling suggestions quick and simple thanks to its extra granular configuration system. Suggester gives staff teams the freedom to manage suggestion flows however they want, through wizard-like setup options, statuses, comments and much more!
